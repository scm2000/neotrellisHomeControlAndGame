# neotrellisHomeControlAndGame
Sample CircuitPython code to use a Neotrellis keypad for home control, plus a simple game

You can learn more about how to use the neotrellis at Adafruit: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neotrellis

I have the code running on a RaspberryPI Pico W.  That board's 3.3v regulator is not heavy enought to power both
the Pico W and a fully lit keypad, so I used a separate 3.3v regulator just for the keypad.
